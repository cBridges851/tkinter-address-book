# tkinter-address-book
This is an application where you can store and view contacts!

## Motivation
This project was to help me get more comfortable with Tkinter while I was learning it in the Christmas holidays in 2020. I had completed the freeCodeCamp tutorial on YouTube for Tkinter, and I like to make projects to solidify what I have learnt.

## Tech/Framework Used
As indicated by the name of the repository, this project uses Tkinter, which is a GUI framework in Python. This also uses a SQL database to store the contacts.

This project is on hold at the moment, so I will provide more information on this README when I pick this project up again and it's complete!
